# Simple-Calculator
📘 Description of the Simple Calculator Program

This Python program is a basic calculator that performs four main arithmetic operations:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division

🔹 How It Works:

Function Definitions

The program defines four functions:

add(x, y) → returns the sum of two numbers.

subtract(x, y) → returns the difference of two numbers.

multiply(x, y) → returns the product of two numbers.

divide(x, y) → returns the quotient of two numbers. If the second number is 0, it returns an error message ("Division by zero").

Menu Display

The program displays a small menu with options (1, 2, 3, 4) for the user to select an operation.

User Input

The user chooses an operation (1–4).

Then the user enters two numbers.

Operation Execution

Based on the choice, the program calls the respective function and displays the result.

Error Handling

If the user enters an invalid choice (not 1–4), the program prints “Invalid input”.

If division by zero is attempted, it shows an error message.
